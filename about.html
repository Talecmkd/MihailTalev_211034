            <p id="first">Hello! I am a software engineering student,
                dancer and choreographer. I have just finished my first year of
                studies and am looking forward to the second year.
                I chose software engineering, mostly because I honestly like
                to sit around on my computer and type stuff, but also because
                I found it really interesting and relaxing to be able to
                work from wherever you like. <br>
            </p>
            <p id="second">
                As I have already said, I am also a dancer, and have been
                for around 5 or 6 years. Started dancing as a challenge and
                as a hobby, but it happened to be the most important thing in
                my life. Could not be able to imagine my life further without it.
                Have been to many competitions, showcases and concerts and also
                filmed many music, and dancing videos, which I would be glad
                if you took a look at them in my Portfolio! :)
            </p>
